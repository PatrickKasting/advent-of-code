# Advent of Code

My solutions to the code puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I have currently solved 50 out of 50 puzzles from 2022 and 47 out of 50 puzzles from 2023. I use the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

I make no attempt to validate the puzzle inputs: The program will simply panic with a stack trace, if you provide an input that is invalid according to the puzzle description. However, my solutions should work for all inputs that are valid. That is, a solution doesn't rely on properties that only the one given input has.
