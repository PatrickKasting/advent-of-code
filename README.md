# Advent of Code

My solutions to the code puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I have solved all puzzles from 2021, 2022, and 2023. I use the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

I make no attempt to validate the puzzle inputs: The program will simply panic with a stack trace, if you provide an input that is invalid according to the puzzle description. However, my solutions should work for all inputs that are valid. That is, whenever possible, a solution doesn't rely on properties that only the one given input has.
